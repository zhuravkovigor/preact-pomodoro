**Preact Pomodoro** is a sleek and minimal Pomodoro timer built with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) and [Vite](https://vite.dev).
Designed as a learning project, it's both developer-friendly and user-focused — easy to run, intuitive to use, and beautifully styled based on a Figma Community prototype.
